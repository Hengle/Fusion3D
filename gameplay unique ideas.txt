---Talk to PNGs
---PNG talking between them and to you
---Dash attack (when you press advance twice, player rush and uses his kick or hands to attack) 
   Useful if you are with no weapons and can be good finishers attacks
---Dash back, good to avoid close attacks
---Dash left or right, fast strife moves
---Shield gameplay -> the shield gameplay will be a protective screen wich will appear in front of the heroine/hero
   The shield doesnt appear long in order to preserve the batteries
   So the shield must be used at the right time when the attack occurs
   If done right -> you can protect yourself cause the shield will absorve the ennemy's energy
   If done at the perfect time -> you send back the projectile or the attack to the ennemy !

   We can change stuff around it, i thought we could add a little png style to the shield, more you kill ennemies and more the shield evolves
   At high levels, the shield would be more effective and easy to use ?

   Since we gonna have the regular double weapon handed, i think the shield should come up from something on their body (like a device strapped on their bodies )
   So gameplay example
   Someone appears, shoot you 1 projectile, you activate the shield right and the projectile returns him, making him slow and you can easier finish him

   Some aliens later could have the same type of shield and send you back your projectiles !

   Two types of shield
   Square shield : opacity heavy (you can see much ), energy reduced all the time or quick
   Circle shield : opacity low (you can see ), energy heavy

   Hidden move :
   At high xp shield, you can hold assigned mouse click and launch a spectral version of that shield

---For example mapping :
   Left mouse : Shield
   Right mouse : attacks (or the oppposite )

---Making the jumps auto (if possible)

---Duck, for maybe avoid giant middle attacks ?
