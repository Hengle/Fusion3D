---Heroine Private Military currently, before she was a cop back on earth, a bit before changing to a private company
 Her officially mission is to protect the space Crew with her Teammate (secret lover )
 Physically she is african type person, Her parents are from Namibia and Benin
 She is a strong, heavy type woman of 36 years old
 Her strenght is that she is eloquent, logical and very good at her work, brings always in bad situations the best viable solutions (she have huge exp of this type of work )
 her weakness is that she wants to control everything, wich can leads to some big issues sometimes, she also listens too much people
 Gameplay-wise : She will have guns, laser etc, police batons, weapons that extend themselves type ones + some common weapons to both
                 Her dashes would be way slower than her Teammate
                 Her moves around (run, left, right etc) are a bit slower than the hero
                 Her shield would be way better than her Male counterpart, better features in general
                 She have the ability to talk, command people (not the captain, he is above the private military team )
                 -We can add one ability later

---Hero Private Military currently (started at that company, he is there longer than the heroine )
 His officially mission is to protect the space Crew with his Female Teammate
 Physically he is a young white person, his parents are from Europe (i can change to USA or else if you want )
 He is "thinner" but Taller than the heroine, he is way faster and agile as a cat
 His age is 28 years old
 His strenght is that he is loyal, and very pro and very agile guy, he can also be surprising in a good way sometimes
 His Weakness is that he is too zealous aka takes his job too seriously, very hard minded on that sector, 
 also very inexperienced even though he is in the private military since longer time than the heroine
 He is above rookie though, his grade is under the heroine but they get good together
 He might have an headphones on his head.
 Gameplay-wise : He will have guns, laser etc, guns military, grenades and bombs
                 His dashes are way faster than the heroine
                 His moves around (run, left, right etc) are a bit faster than the heroine
                 His shield is less good than her female counterpart (since the dashes are way better, you can compensate with that )
                 He have the ability to talk, command people (not the captain, he is above the private military team )
                 -We can add one ability later

 ---Journalist(Radical activist )
    First time we see her, she will tell she is working for a bogus Journal
    Her officially mission is to Blow up the Gun/weapon Lab of the Chief scientist of the Fleet
    The Goal is to force the Fleet to meet the space Point who emitted that strange signal, unarmed in order to avoid possible Killings.
    She belongs to a female terrorist antiwar/environmentalist group and was actually looked by the Police down Earth after the many protest she started.
    That mission is a good way to escape the Police for a while and sabotage the Space earth mission in order to force her views onto the Crew and the people who financed it
    Physically she will be very mature, small and very active and provocative :especially with the Authority in general.
    Her age would be around 55 years old
    Her strenght is that she is active, and good at attacking people, she should not be underestimated
    His Weakness is that she will be very annoying and talk a lot mostly cause of her ideologies (Against war, space colonisation and guns )
    She is very driven and hard minded and have tendency to go against us
    Also her green bandana is very symbolic of the terrorist group visual identity.
    Gameplay-wise : We dont play her but there will commands for her depending if we keep her or not, if we have her or not
                    Command example : Attack (will look around and go attack anyone but us regardless )
                                      Defense (will mostly attack when we got attacked )
                                      Neutral (if possible, a mixture of both )
                                      Look (she will look for ammo, armor and such )
                                      >Note : Protesters as sidekicks would have better armors for us than the scientists sidekicks
                                      That woman would be actually the first Boss on the game, we gonna learn basic gameplay with her and her activist partner
                                      Her partner would be the first Miniboss
                                      We gonna learn basic of the shield use, shield use, counter attack , etc
                                      We dont kill them, mostly beat them and put them in jail
                                      After that when we go see them, a gigantic explosion is heard and we think they might have a third radical girl in there
                                      We discover after seeing the couple Botanist and linguist killed that it's a new form of life attacking us
                                      The captain before dying tell us that we are invadedand we have to find the Hole where they come from and secure the place with our male teammate
                                      If we pick the male hero, the beginning is a bit different but it would be the same eventually ( we will go more with the scientist and talk to them more )

                                      

---Botanist ( Woman with glasses )
   Non playable Character
   She embarks with her husband to know more about that space point emitter, also to have a chance to work on something new and incredible
   She is joyful and very impressive with her plant skills
   She is 40 years old
   She would get killed by the alien invasion (or not, maybe we can save all characters )


---Linguist  ( Male )
   Non playable Character
   He embarks to be helpful to the crew with possible Alien humanoid encounters
   He is very smart and talk cautiously, he is 45 years old
   He is killed by the alien invasion trying to save her wife (or not, maybe we can save all characters )
   They are one of the few couple officially out there in the fleet

---Scientist chief (Will provide the best weapons, earth-side )
   Non Playable character
   He is the expedition chief officially, most advanced science knowledge and will be an ennemy of the female activists especially when his favorite second is turned against him by the Journalist
   He is a genius with a very bad socially behaviour -> he hates people, especially their "under intelligence".
   If we pick the male hero, we will get him and her third scientist female as sidekicks
   They will create weapons either on place or in the lab
   He is 48 years old, and single.
   He is kind of tall, thin, not suited for physical battle, get scared kick into the heat of combats.

---Scientist female 1 (radical activist )
   Non Playable character
   She is a part of the official Scientist chief team, she is the most admired teammate of the scientist crew, until she reveals her true nature
   She becomes a radical activist during the beginning and helps the female journalist to get inside the lab and destroy everything
   Back on Earth she was already approached and pushed into activism by the Journalist, so they knew each other since.
   She is a genius also, aged 26 years old, in love with the fake journalist character.
   She will be the first Mini boss of the game.
   I think to defeat her, we might have to use the shield features, for example if she throw us an object, we activate the shield and it send the projectile back to her
   So it brings an overture to attack her and lock her up, otherwise classical attacks wont work on her.
   
   Alien actions invasion of our spaceship will start after we caught the two female protesters
   When we do, we gonna make all the characters gather and speak about that issue with the two girls in jail
   When the attack occurs, with the space cameras we see the aliens humanoid goin in with guns
   Characters will establish a strategy and then the gamer will choose who he wants in for the adventure
   The rest would go in jail since it's almost impossible to break the entry there.
   If the gamer wants to swap characters, go to jail any time and make those swap characters sidekick

---Scientist female 2
   Non Playable character
   She is a part of the official Scientist chief team, she is very talented but not the favorite of the scientist chief, wich makes her jealous of the other female one
   She is righteous, strong minded and very hateful of activism and civil disobedience
   She will be a rival/ennemy of the Radical female scientist
   She helps the scientist team chief to create weapons and have no problem with that unlike her rival
   She loves Police and authority and will always take our side
   She is 28 years old and married.


---Scientist Male
   Non Playable character
   He is a huge man but very kind, doesnt want much problems and is one of the best scientist in the world back there on Earth

   Very Joyful, always smiling, heartful, she is the main medic of the crew and also a very advanced one back on Earth
   She is not afraid of space discovery and wants to be a part of something unique in mankind's history
   She admires (too much) the captain of the crew and went in because of him
   I dont know if we can use her ingame for the Health system or no but she could be a good finder of health kits and even fix you in some instances 
   (for example in the end , in the Moon , we can get poisoned or blind by creatures up there )
   She is 35 years old and single, she also get scared quick in tense situation, panic mode and all

   All members of the spaceship would respond to him with an exception of the Rich man
