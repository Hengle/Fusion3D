1-Game starts with a choice :
We play a female soldier or male, we can make a choice, depending it, the gameplay would be weapons you found 

2-After choice, we are inside a spaceship with people towards a planet for exploration and discovery
These people are scientific and civilians, casual discuss and life under the spaceship (maybe we can explore it, freely )

3-When the spaceship gets attacked and stopped after our walk inside spaceship, a giant spaceship is shown upper us (gamer dont see it )
Putting a tube inside our spaceship and launch soldiers inside
We see our people getting killed (maybe we can try a gameplay when we have to save people ? dunno )

4-It get boarded by aliens and they invade it, and we get the
alarm stuff and we fight them
and when we kill them, we can get their weapons, depending if we are
good and fast , we get their weapons full of munitions (if you are
slow, you get them but the magazine is empty or few are left )



5-Our spaceship eventually get destroyed, we escape it to get inside (cause we are very good )
theirs and become the new invaders, instead of destroying their
spaceship : we use it to get back to earth after killing the commander


6-The spaceship though doesnt go Earth, instead end up in one of their Horrible infested Moon
Apparently a last gift from the commander we killed 


7-Moon surface, either we put a ton of ennemies or few one (maybe that choice will change depending the soldier we choose )


8-We find that structure and get inside (if we go with different moon, we change the number of layers of that complex and the colors maybe )


9-Inside defeat the craziest monsters possible and in the end, we realize those monsters were garding a pure artefact with abilities


10- we get inside and its all white , we end the game there with music and credits.


To sum up
Locations game :
---First part game :  Spaceship earth (ours )
---Second part game : Spaceship Alien (we can give reference names to the spaceship for fun )
---Third part :       One of the 79 known Moon of Jupiter (we can name the game : the 80th moon of Jupiter )
---Final Part :       Mysterious structure (we will get deep and deep and deep and inside the deepest we will find that light artefact wich put us "somewhere" )

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons_of_Jupiter
We will go deep on that when we will be there

The spaceship will need designs : extern designs for when we see ours destroyed
But i'll mostly focus on the designs of texture and all, thats the most important

Also we will need to agree before i start so that prevent me drawing for nothing
We will agree part by part, so dont worry, that allows us to take it cautious and eventually go back
